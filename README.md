## What you need before starting(_out-dated_)

  * BeautifulSoup4
  * Python3
  * Virtual Environment(recommended)
  * library[requests, json, lxml]
  
  
## How to run

  1. clone the repository into your API server.
  2. make a python vertual environment.
  3. get into the vertualenv
  4. import contributions.py in the code in which you will use API.
  5. use the function such as "getContributionsDaily("Yunbin-Chang")"
  
  * The availiable function list is below.
  

	
## How to Import API
  * Use Below Code
   ```python
    import contributions as ct
   ```
   
## How to Call Function
  * Use Below Code
   ```python
    print(ct.getContributionsDaily("USER NAME HERE"))
   ```
   
## Function for API (This part is out-dated, will be updated soon)

  #### `getContributionsDaily("USER NAME HERE")`

  * this provides a json data contains how many contributed in a day with a contributed date.
      ignoring a no contributed date.
  * JSON Example
  
   ```json
    [
      {
          "date" : "2017-02-27",
          "count" : "2"
      },
      {
          "date" : "2017-02-28",
          "count" : "10"
      }
    ]
   ```
   above json data ignored many contributing-date beacause the json is too big to write here.

## Range of Data

	about last 1 year from now when you make a request for data.
  
  
## How does it works

  This API parse a contributions data from https://github.com/(some-user-name)

  Especially from below parts of the page.

![img/contribution-rect](https://github.com/Yunbin-Chang/Github-Contributions-API/blob/master/img/contribution-rects.PNG)

  each code for above color-filled rectangles is formatted as

  ```html
    <rect class="day" width="10" height="10" x="?" y="?" fill="#ebedf0" data-count="<counting>" data-date="yyyy-mm-dd"/>
  ```

  so the API parses from these parts and arrange and decorate with json and respond to request.
